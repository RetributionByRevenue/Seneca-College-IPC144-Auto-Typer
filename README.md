Enough is enough, seneca college IPC144 Milestone 4 is by far the biggest time wasting assignment of my life.
Given i am already an experienced programmer suffering away in BS classes, i went out of my way to create a program that will automatically type out ALL 110 inputs correctly directly into the Milestone 4 ssh terminal. 

**What to do and Insturctions:**


You need to download from the link provided below. You will download a zip file and there is a txt file containing detailed instructions. Copy and paste the contents of make_code.py into your old outdated make_code.py that is provided to you.

**Brief summary:**<br>
In short, i have included a portable python compiler and python program that will generate code that will make a windows batch file or linux .sh script.  On windows, all you need to do is double click "outputfile" as seen in the video picture at the top of this page.

This will work only on Linux (Linux people are based) and Windows. (I do not support Mac OS and i think its so cringe to use a macbook... lol)<br>
