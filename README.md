Enough is enough, seneca college IPC144 Milestone 4 is by far the biggest time wasting assignment of my life.
Given i am already an experienced programmer suffering away in BS classes, i went out of my way to create a program that will automatically type out ALL 110 inputs correctly directly into the Milestone 4 ssh terminal. 

This will work only on Linux (Linux people are based) and Windows. (I do not support Mac OS nor do i like people that use macbooks)

How it works and Insturctions?
