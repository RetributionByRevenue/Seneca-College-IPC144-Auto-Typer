Enough is enough, seneca college IPC144 Milestone 4 is by far the longest programming assignment of my life.
I have ADHD, typing the correct inputs for IPC144 can be a very difficult task that will surely take dozens of attempts.
Moreover, i am already an experienced programmer looking for a real challenge, i went out of my way to create a program that will automatically type out ALL 110 inputs correctly directly into the Milestone 4 ssh terminal. 

**April 20 Update**<br>
**C Programming Section:**<br>
I have ported my python script into C language! This means you can run this C program on Visual Studio that we downloaded in class.  My C program called "make_output.c" will generate a windows batch file that will Automatically type all desired inputs into the ssh matrix!!!

**Python Programming Section:**<br>
**What to do and Insturctions:**<br>
You need to download from the link provided below. You will download a zip file and there is a txt file containing detailed instructions. Copy and paste the contents of make_code.py into your old outdated make_code.py that is provided to you.<br>
Python code preview (Python + Linux implementation): https://ghostbin.co/paste/xashc<br>
**Brief summary:**<br>
In short, i have included a portable python compiler and python program that will generate code that will make a windows batch file or linux .sh script.  On windows, all you need to do is double click "outputfile" as seen in the video picture at the top of this page.<br>
